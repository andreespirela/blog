### Chaos

Chaos is a funny word. When we think of chaos we tend to think about wars, an action leading to a Ragnarok event,
or something potentially out of control. But, do we ever think about the real chaos? We are living in the technology era and listen carefully, anything, absolutely anything can be chaos.
What's _funny_ about the chaos word is that the most chaotic things nowadays are based on technology, but we never think about it... **why?**
<br><br>
We tend to think about technology and internet like this kind of place that is safe, this kind of place we don't really care about what happens in it. In our own human nature, we give dedicated importance to only tangible things.
<br><br>
I think you get my idea, but let me explain what chaos really means:
- If AWS (Amazon Web Service) gets hacked and their servers get polluted with a computer warm enough to not be able to recover, it would take down Amazon, Netflix, Twitch, LinkedIn, Facebook, Arbnb, and would potentially affect banking services around the world. From a no-recovery point, almost the whole population would be compromised.
- If Comcast and AT&T get hacked, a hacker would potentially have access to the systems of providing services. This would mean, they could potentially disconnect around 100M people and companies in the United States from having internet access. Enough to cause an apocalyptic crisis, leaving a big portion of the country without a way to communicate or receive news.
- If the services that control power stations get hacked, it would indicate a major national risk to the nation. Similar to this, part of New York and Canada experienced a blackout in 2003 due to a software bug. Something like this could cause a world-wide crisis.

I think I've shown you what chaos means. Chaos is not always a war, not always something visible, but the most concerning definition of chaos has become something intangible.

Although this post was supposed to be a statement of purpose, I thought we should cover this instead... at the end of the day, no one really talks about it.
