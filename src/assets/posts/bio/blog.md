I’m Andres, an ordinary software engineer with extraordinary thoughts about code, space, and technology in general. Born in 2001, my career began as a 9-year-old with a lot of questions. These questions have led me to a lifetime adventure that’s still taking place.  
<br>
<br>
As a very young kid, I started programming during my free time by asking myself questions about how computers and websites worked, and answering those questions by building them. What I didn’t know back then is that a hobby would become my purpose in life and source of income.
<br>
<br>
At 18 years old, I joined <b>Modernizing Medicine</b> (a large tech company in South Florida) for 8 months, then, I joined <b>NCCI</b>, one of the largest data analytics provider for insurance companies in the US. As of 2021, I am back where everything started: <i>Modernizing Medicine</i>.  
<br>
<br>
In 2020, I joined the open source community where I developed a framework called <a href="https://github.com/mandarineorg/mandarinets" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 transition ease-in-out duration-150">Mandarine</a>. Among other contributions, I’m currently helping <a href="https://verto.exchange" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 transition ease-in-out duration-150">The Verto Protocol</a>, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange or DEX.
<br>
<br>
As a coder, I’m a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 transition ease-in-out duration-150">Typescript</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 transition ease-in-out duration-150">Rust</a> lover.<br>
As a human, my passion comes down to:
<ul>
<li>- Architectural Tasks</li>
<li>- Distributed Systems</li>
<li>- Rocket Engineering</li>
<li>- Economics</li>
</ul>
<br>
I was born to code,
code makes me who I am,
overcoming greater challenges is just part of it.
