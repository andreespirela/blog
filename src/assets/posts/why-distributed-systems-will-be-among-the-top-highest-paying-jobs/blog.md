Before starting this blog I would like to clarify that this post is not about cryptocurrencies whatsoever, although, we will explore concepts related to it.
<br>
<br>

In the last few years we have seen the growth of an industry that will change everything, in fact, it already has: The industry of distributed systems.  
Distributed computing is a field of computer science which is not new by any means as its creation goes back to the early 60s. Since its creations, it has brought major breakthroughs in modern civilization, such as: 
- The Internet, 
- Routing algorithms (mainly load balancers), 
- the World-Wide-Web (WWW), 
- Aircraft Systems, 
- Cloud Computing 
- ...and even Artificial Intelligence in the form of interconnected cars that avoid crashes and save lives. 

I'm sure all this sounds familiar and these industries are already valued in billions of dollars to the point that if we combine every single industry I mentioned, we would have a sector with over a trillion dollar. This is not surprise for anyone, we know that Technology means money, and everyone working in such sector has the opportunity to make value out of nothing or get the kind of salaries many people wish for.  

While it's true that distributed systems have been a key part for everything we use in our daily basis, if you are a software engineer, you are not necessarily a distributed system engineer which means, the economic growth or growth in usage of distributed applications doesn't necessarily impact your job, it's simple: _WWW_ is a distributed-system application but creating a website doesn't necessarily need your knowledge about distributed computing.

That's about to change... Web3 is here.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 transition ease-in-out duration-150">Web3</a> is an emerging concept that's making its way into existence little by little. It consists in only one important thing:
- Trustless Applications based on decentralization


Trustless Applications are known because they do not have any middle man, it's a system of distributed computers deciding whether what's being asked is a valid request or not.<br> The most famous example of Trustless Applications are **cryptocurrencies** like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
<br><br>

### Blockchain  
<br>

The technology behind cryptocurrencies and many other applications is called <a class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 transition ease-in-out duration-150" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a> which is a concept that works under distributed computing. Its exact technical details can be quiet complicated which is why I won't get into it, but in simple words, this is how it works:
- Blockchain is based on: Immutability and Decentralization.
- It's a network of interconnected computers (Nodes)
- These computers share the same information and maintain copies of these pieces of information.
- In Blockchain, information is synonymous of Blocks. Blocks don't only contain data, but they contain metadata.
  - The Block's metadata contains a hash from the previous block, and it's deterministic: If the previous block changes its information, the next block will have a different hash, and the network **will go out of sync**.
- If a node commits changes to a block, the network needs to recompute all the blocks' metadata which is done through a consensus process.
  - Every blockchain implementation can have different consensus rules. In Bitcoin for example, 51% needs to agree on the incoming information. If agreement is reached, the new block is propagated. Otherwise, it gets rejected.
- The more computers you have connected, the less vulnerable is your blockchain as it will be harder for someone to modify information and reach consensus.
- Blockchain is not about cryptocurrencies, but anything that follows the blockchain principles can be considered a blockchain implementation.

### Applications and Smart Contracts

<br> _Blockchain_ is what wraps _Web3_, a better web. Some of the Web3 Applications are:
- Gaming Assets for online gaming.
- Legal registries persisted in the blockchain.
- Real Estate for middle-man transactions.
- Shipping registries.
- Banking Applications: Without the need of a middle-man running verifications, sending transactions across the world in a matter of seconds is possible. It's already done with Cryptocurrencies.
- **Smart Contracts**

_Smart Contracts_ are a consequence of blockchain. It wasn't planned for them to be a thing, it was impossible. It was a beautiful coincidence as they fit right in inside what blockchain guarantees.  
_Smart Contracts_ are pieces of code/programs that run inside the blockchain, this means, all the nodes that are part of the network are responsible for executing them, consensually agreeing on the final output and save their states. They are **trustless applications** as they don't depend on users to execute them and show their output since this is done by the nodes connected to the network.
_Smart Contracts_ are:
- Deterministic (the input provided by the user must always lead to the same output)
- Programs that run in multiple decentralized computers at the same time, instead of centralized servers.
- With them, it's possible to program pieces of code that can guarantee trustworthiness throughout the years in important areas such as:
  - Supply Chain
  - Virtual Identity
  - Legal Contracts like employment contracts
  - Mortgage Transactions
  - Automated Payments

### Joining the Highest-Paid Club

Now, let's get into the details on how this impacts developers and their profits. _Blockchain_ is the based for a new economic system which will affect banking, economic models, and multiple businesses like supply chain management.
<br><br> _Blockchain_ leading the next economic and technological revolution will change everything as we know it, the blockchain industry itself is expected to reach 500B dollars in market capitalization by 2028.
<br><br>
Unlike software engineers for _Web2_ where you don't need to know the specific to assemble a web2-like application, _Web3_ requires distributed-computing knowledge, its own nature demands it; But it's not only about distributed-computing knowledge, it's about blockchain knowledge: How to create a blockchain or create programs inside existing blockchains like Ethereum with Smart Contracts.
<br><br>
According to <b>Zip Recruiter</b>, a Solidity Engineer (Language used inside the Ethereum Virtual Machine for smart contracts) makes $134k dollars average (per year), whereas a regular software engineer makes $80k in average. In this context, being a blockchain programmer makes you around $50k dollars more a year.
<br>
On the other hand, according to <i>Zip Recruiter</i> a regular _blockchain engineer_ with enough knowledge to create a blockchain implementation from scratch, or someone who deeply understands the current technologies in the market, makes a base salary of $154k dollars a year.
<br>
<br>
These salaries are far from being decreased, and the reality is that the world is evolving into a web3-based world. This change has been slowly happening, and it's now becoming the next major breakthrough. In the future, most of our daily lives will be blockchain based. Things such as buying a house in your country or oversees will be fast and simple. And at some point, political elections could be backed up by these technologies, bringing fairness and transparency to these faulty human processes.
<br> Web3 won't be like the internet, it won't be a change as visible as creating a website or the email was around 30 years ago, but about everything in society will be slowly wrapped in this new concept, in fact, you might be already using blockchain-based technologies without knowing it.
<br>
<br>
Finally, Web3 and Blockchain engineers are set to become among the highest paid professions in the world, and for current software engineers, the least you can do is familiarize yourself with these concepts as it will be an inevitable change.
<br>
<br>
Software Engineers are arguably already the profession with the highest income on a yearly basis, but the numbers we are about to see with the growth of the Web3 industry have never been seen in any previous technological or industrial revolution. It won't only bring more money to anyone who works with it, but it will bring more freedom and fairness to the internet, and the world, and that isn't a clichÄ—, Blockchain itself is the technological resolution for such desired qualities.
